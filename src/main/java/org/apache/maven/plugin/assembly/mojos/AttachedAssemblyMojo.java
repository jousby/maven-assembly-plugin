/**
 * Assemble an application bundle or distribution from an assembly descriptor, WITHOUT first forcing Maven to build all
 * POMs to the <code>package</code> phase (as is required by the <code>assembly:assembly</code> goal). <br/>
 * 
 * <b>NOTE:</b> This goal should ONLY be run from the command line, and if building a multimodule project it should be
 * used from the root POM. Use the <code>assembly:single</code> goal for binding your assembly to the lifecycle.
